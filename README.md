# Deltafin - A Jellyfin CLI Client.

This doesn't do much for now. Here are the following features:

- Can log in to a server (through HTTP or reverse proxy).
- Ability to show publicly available users
- Ability to save user credentials.
- Shows user's categories and media from that category.


Planned:
- Be able to select content from library.
- Ability to select and playback content (probably through MPV).
- Ability to login through API Key


Please note, this isn't intended to be a fully fledged client. I'm mainly using this to practice web scraping and using APIs.
