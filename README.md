# Deltafin - A Jellyfin CLI Client.

A very basic CLI client for Jellyfin written in Python to playback videos.

Here are the implemented features:

- Can log in to a server (through HTTP or reverse proxy).
- Ability to show publicly available users
- Ability to save user credentials.
- Ability to list categories and media files.
- Ability to play media files.


Planned features:
- Ability to login through API Key
- Grab the specific ID of a media file without user interaction.


Please note, this isn't intended to be a fully fledged client. I'm mainly using this to practice web scraping and using APIs.
